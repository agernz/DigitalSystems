Programs I independently wrote to solve problems in my Digital Systems course  
State Machine Simplifier is an extension of the QuineMcCluskey program.    
The user will enter their state table and the program will find the best equations.  
In order to find the boolean equations the McCluskey method is used.  
(Still a work in progress)
